<p> My favorite hobby is traveling around the world 🌎 🌍 🗺 🌏 , so I can learn some knowledge and relax. Sometimes in every summer me and my sister and mother would travel to Ahmedabad to visit my grand parents, shopping, relax, and enjoy the summer of the highest temperature. Sometimes in the society where my grandparents live we play in the garden at night or at sunshine time. Sometimes we go to Atlanta Ga for my father's business show, and we stay in a hotel or at my uncle and aunt's house. Half of the time we go to Jacksonville or Orlando FL to relax or go shopping. </p>
